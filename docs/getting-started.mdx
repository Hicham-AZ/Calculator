# Getting Started

This guide will help you get the Calculator application up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
- **Version**: Java 11 or higher
- **Download**: [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

To verify your Java installation:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

### Apache Maven (Optional but Recommended)
- **Version**: 3.6 or higher
- **Download**: [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

To verify your Maven installation:
```bash
mvn -version
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone from GitHub
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HouariZegai/Calculator.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Calculator
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP
1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HouariZegai/Calculator)
2. Click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location

## Running the Application

### Using Maven (Recommended)
```bash
# Compile the project
mvn compile

# Run the application
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.houarizegai.calculator.App"
```

### Using Java directly
```bash
# Compile the source files
javac -cp "src/main/java" -d target/classes src/main/java/com/houarizegai/calculator/*.java src/main/java/com/houarizegai/calculator/**/*.java

# Add dependencies to classpath (you'll need to download Jackson libraries)
# For simplicity, use Maven approach above

# Run the application
java -cp target/classes com.houarizegai.calculator.App
```

### Using an IDE

#### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Select "Open" or "Import Project"
3. Navigate to the Calculator directory and select it
4. IntelliJ will automatically detect the Maven project
5. Wait for the project to be indexed
6. Right-click on `App.java` and select "Run 'App.main()'"

#### Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse
2. Go to File → Import → Existing Maven Projects
3. Select the Calculator directory
4. Eclipse will import the project
5. Right-click on `App.java` and select "Run As → Java Application"

#### Visual Studio Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Install the "Java Extension Pack" if not already installed
3. Open the Calculator folder
4. VS Code will automatically detect the Java project
5. Press `F5` or use the Run button to start the application

## Building the Project

### Compile Only
```bash
mvn compile
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Package JAR file
```bash
mvn package
```
This creates a JAR file in the `target/` directory.

### Clean Build
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

## First Launch

When you run the application for the first time:

1. **Calculator Window**: A calculator window will open with the default Light theme
2. **Calculator Type**: You can switch between "Standard" and "Scientific" modes using the dropdown
3. **Theme Selection**: Use the theme dropdown to switch between Light and Dark themes
4. **Basic Operations**: Start with simple calculations like `2 + 3 =`

## Project Structure

After installation, your project structure should look like this:

```
Calculator/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/houarizegai/calculator/
│   │   │       ├── App.java
│   │   │       ├── ui/
│   │   │       ├── theme/
│   │   │       └── util/
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       └── application.yaml
│   └── test/
│       └── java/
├── target/ (created after compilation)
├── screenshots/
├── docs/
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Java Version Error
**Problem**: `Error: A JNI error has occurred` or version compatibility issues
**Solution**: Ensure you're using Java 11 or higher

#### Maven Not Found
**Problem**: `'mvn' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
**Solution**: 
1. Install Maven or add it to your PATH
2. Alternatively, use your IDE's built-in Maven support

#### Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `ClassNotFoundException` for Jackson libraries
**Solution**: Use Maven to handle dependencies automatically:
```bash
mvn dependency:resolve
```

#### Theme Loading Issues
**Problem**: Calculator appears with default colors, themes not working
**Solution**: Ensure `application.yaml` is in the correct location (`src/main/resources/`)

### Performance Tips

1. **Memory**: The application uses minimal memory, but ensure you have at least 64MB free RAM
2. **Display**: Works best with screen resolution 800x600 or higher
3. **Java Performance**: Use the latest Java version for best performance

## Next Steps

Now that you have the Calculator running:

1. Explore the [Features](./features.mdx) to learn about all available functionality
2. Check out the [Architecture](./architecture.mdx) to understand the codebase
3. Learn about [Theming](./theming.mdx) to customize the appearance
4. Review the [API Reference](./api.mdx) if you want to extend the application
